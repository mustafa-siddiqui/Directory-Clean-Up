# Directory Clean Up

A python script to sort/clean up a directory. It basically takes files with their extensions (like pdf, docx, png) and creates folders with the respective name of their extension and moves the files in those folders inside the directory.

#### Usage
To run this script:
Type this if the directory to be cleaned up does not contain cleanUp.py:
```
python3 cleanUp.py --path <path-to-directory>
```
Otherwise, type:
```
python3 cleanUp.py
```
like any other python file.
